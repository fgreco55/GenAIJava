#OpenAI Playground - Lab exercises

1. Create a helpful Java expert that can explain Java 22 at a grammar-school or high-school level.  Copy/Paste text from a good information source, e.g., [InfoWorld May 19, 2024](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3708329/jdk-22-the-new-features-in-java-22.html)

2. Pick a Java topic from [Oracle Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) and ask ChatGPT to explain the topic from a non-programmer view.

3. Experiment with the temperature parameter.  Try extreme values and evaluate your results.

4. Try the same prompt exercises from the Prompt Techniques labs in the prior lesson.  What are the differences?
