# Embedding Vectors - Lab exercises

1. Get a string from the user.  Retrieve the embedding vector for this string from an LLM service (eg, OpenAIâ€™s embedding service) and display it. Embeddings/Embeddings

2. Get two strings from the user.  Retrieve the embedding vectors for both strings and calculate the similarity between them using cosine similarity. Use the cosine similarity methods shown in the slides (and repo). Embeddings/CompareEmbeddings

3. EXTRA - Create a text file of various strings.  Now get a text string from the user and compare the similarity to each line in the text file.   Sort them and display the similarity scores.   Use the same cosine similarity methods as #2.

4. EXTRA EXTRA - Continue with #3 and also display the top N similarity strings.   Embeddings/MostSimilar
