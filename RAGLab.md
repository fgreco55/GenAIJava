# RAG - Lab exercises

1. Update your Chatbot from a prior lab to add “private” data as context.  Add the ability to read in several files at the beginning of the session.  Create USER messages from those files.  Try asking your Chatbot about those files.  Now remove those files and rerun your Chatbot.  What is the difference?
Note: Make sure you are maintaining the conversation context.   See GenAIJava/FileChatbotApp

2. Ask your Chatbot questions unrelated to your private data, eg., finance, sports, cooking, the weather, etc.  How might you instruct your Chatbot to avoid responding to these prompts?
